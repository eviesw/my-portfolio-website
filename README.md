# Portfolio Website

This portfolio website was created as part of the User Interface Basics module in my web development course. The site is built using HTML, CSS, and Tailwind CSS. I really enjoyed experimenting with the design and turning ideas into code, as well as enhancing the site's responsiveness. As I continue to develop my skills, I will update it with new projects (and new code ðŸ˜„).
